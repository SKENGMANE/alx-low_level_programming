[1-main.c](https://github.com/SKENGMANE/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/1-main.c)
* Commented the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
---
[2-largest_number.c]((https://github.com/SKENGMANE/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/2-largest_number.c)
* Fixed the code so this program prints the largest of three integers.
---
[3-print_remaining_days.c](https://github.com/SKENGMANE/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/3-print_remaining_days.c)
* Debugged the code so this program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.

[main.h](https://github.com/SKENGMANE/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/main.h)
* Contains the prototypes used in this task
